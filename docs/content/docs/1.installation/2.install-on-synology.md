# Install on Synology
::lead-p
Financial Freedom can run on Synology DSM 7.2+ using Docker Compose. This guide will walk you through the steps to get Financial Freedom up and running on your Synology NAS.
::

## Prerequisites
- It is highly recommended that you upgrade to DSM 7.2+ before proceeding so you can utilize the [Container Manager](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/docker) package that ships with DSM 7.2+.

## Create a folder to store your Financial Freedom data
Open the File Station and create a new folder to store your Financial Freedom data. This folder will be mounted into the Financial Freedom container. It is recommended to put this on your fastest volume (SSD if available).

![Create a folder to store your Financial Freedom data](/images/docs/install-synology/create-folder.png)

In the example above, a shared folder (called `docker`) is created, and then we can create a `financial-freedom` folder inside of it. All of the data for Financial Freedom will be stored in this folder.

### Create additional directories underneath
1. - `logs`
2. - `sessions`
3. - `database`

## Prepare env file
Next, we need to create an `.env` file to store our environment variables.

1. Download the [`.env.example` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/financial-freedom/main/.env.example) from the Financial Freedom repository.
2. Open the file and update the appropriate values to your choice.
3. Upload the modified file to the Financial Freedom folder you created in the previous step.
4. Rename the file to `.env` (remove the `.example` extension).

In summary, your folder structure should look like this once you are done:

::code-panel
---
label: Folder Structure of `/docker/financial-freedom`
---
```txt
.
├── .env
├── database/
├── logs/
└── sessions/
```
::

## Install Container Manager
Open the Package Center and search for `Container Manager`. Click `Install` to install the package.

## Create a New Project
Open the Container Manager and click `Create` under `Projects` to create a new project.

![Create a New Project](/images/docs/install-synology/create-project.png)

Set the following values:
1. **Project name**: `financial-freedom`
2. **Path**: Select the folder you created in the first step.
3. **Source**: `Create docker-compose.yml`

You can use this template for the `docker-compose.yml` file:

::code-panel
---
label: docker-compose.yml
---
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:

  php:
    image: serversideup/financial-freedom:edge
    ports:
      - 8080:80
      - 8443:443
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/var/www/html/storage/logs
      - ./sessions:/var/www/html/storage/framework/sessions
    depends_on:
      - mariadb

  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:10.11
    volumes:
      - ./database:/var/lib/mysql
    env_file:
      - .env
```

Press `Next` to continue and you do not have to enable the web portal via Web Station if Synology prompts you.

## Accessing Financial Freedom
Once the project is created, you can access Financial Freedom by going to `https://<your-synology-ip>:8443` in your browser.
